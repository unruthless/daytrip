# Tailwind <3 Contributors

Help make Tailwind better! I welcome contributions of code, design, content, documentation, and anything else that would help improve this tool. Thank you in advance!

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE (if you <b><i>don't</i></b> know git)

A long time ago, someone sat me down for a few hours and showed me how to use this crazy git thang. (It was at a Whole Foods in Southern California, of all places. The coffeeshop next door was closed, and Whole Foods had free wifi.)

That afternoon's impromptu, hands-on lesson in version control was and remains one of the kindest and most helpful things anyone has ever done for me professionally.

I'd like to pay it forward.

<b>If you've never contributed to a project on GitHub before, and would like Tailwind to be your first:</b>

1. You are awesome.
2. Read through the rest of this document to get an overview of the process - don't worry if parts don't make sense yet!
3. Email me at ruthie@cyclingcoder.com or ping me on twitter at [@unruthless](https://www.twitter.com/unruthless), and we'll schedule a coffee or Skype session and go through the whole thing together.
4. Seriously, you are awesome.

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE (if you <b><i>do</i></b> know git)

### 1. Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one, and log in.

* Here's the [signup link](https://github.com/signup/free).

### 2. Submit an [issue ticket](https://github.com/unruthless/tailwind/issues) for your issue:

* Are you reporting a bug? Please describe the issue and include steps to reproduce the bug, and tag the issue ticket 'bug'.
* Do you have a suggestion for an enhancement? I'd love to hear it, and if you have a sketch or diagram, please upload it. Make sure to tag the issue ticket 'enhancement'.
* Do you have a question about the project? Ask away! Please tag the issue ticket 'question'.

### 3. Contribute a patch:

1. On GitHub, [fork this repository](https://www.github.com/unruthless/tailwind) (we'll refer to this repository, the one at `https://www.github.com/unruthless/tailwind`, as `upstream`). Your fork (which we'll refer to as `origin`) will live on GitHub at `https://www.github.com/[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME]/tailwind`.
2. Clone `origin` onto your computer to create your `working copy` of this repository.
3. In your working copy, create a new branch based on master for your patch. Call this patch branch something like `patch--my-shiny-new-feature` or `patch--browser-crash`. The exact name doesn't matter; just try to make it descriptive.
4. Check out your patch branch, and make your changes. Please stick to Tailwind's existing coding style, and make sure that any incremental commits have descriptive messages.
5. When you're all done, push your patch branch back up to `origin` on GitHub, find the issue ticket in `upstream` that your patch addresses, and submit a pull request against that ticket. I'll review it and either merge it in or suggest changes.
6. Give yourself a high five for contributing to an open source project!
