# Tailwind <3 Contributors

Help make Tailwind better! I welcome contributions of code, design, content, documentation, and anything else that would help improve this tool. Thank you in advance!

# How to contribute

1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) if you don't already have one, and log in.

2. Submit an [issue ticket](https://github.com/unruthless/tailwind/issues) for your issue:

	* Are you reporting a bug? Please describe the issue and include steps to reproduce the bug, and tag the issue ticket 'bug'.
	* Do you have a suggestion for an enhancement? I'd love to hear it, and if you have a sketch or diagram, please upload it. Make sure to tag the issue ticket 'enhancement'.
	* Do you have a question about the project? Ask away! Please tag the issue ticket 'question'.

3. Contribute a patch:

	* On GitHub, fork [this repository](https://www.github.com/unruthless/tailwind) (we'll refer to this repository as `upstream`). Your fork (which we'll refer to as `origin`) will live on GitHub at https://www.github.com/[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME]/tailwind.
	* Clone `origin` onto your computer to create your `working copy` of this repository.
	* In your working copy, create a new branch based on master for your patch. Call this patch branch something like `patch--my-shiny-new-feature` or `patch--browser-crash`. The exact name doesn't matter, but try to make it descriptive.
	* Check out your patch branch, and make your changes.
	* Please stick to the existing coding style, and make sure that your commits have descriptive messages.
	* When you're all done, push your `patch` branch back up to `origin` on GitHub, find the issue ticket in `upstream` that your patch addresses, and submit a pull request against that ticket. I'll review it and either merge it in or suggest changes.
	* Give yourself a high five for contributing to an open source project!

# Help! I don't know what any of that stuff in Step 3 means!

A long time ago, someone sat me down for a few hours and showed me how to use this crazy git thing at a Whole Foods in Southern California. It remains one of the kindest and most helpful things that anyone has ever done for me, professionally. I'd like to pay it forward. To wit: If you don't understand Step 3 at all, or sorta-kinda understand it but need a hand getting through it, email me at ruthie@cyclingcoder.com or ping me on twitter at @unruthless, and we'll schedule a coffee or Skype session and go through the whole thing together.
