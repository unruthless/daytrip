# Tailwind <3 Contributors

Help make Tailwind better! I welcome contributions of code, design, content, documentation, and anything else that would help improve this tool. Thank you in advance!

## How to contribute

### 1. Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one, and log in.

* Here's the [signup link](https://github.com/signup/free).

### 2. Submit an [issue ticket](https://github.com/unruthless/tailwind/issues) for your issue:

* Are you reporting a bug? Please describe the issue and include steps to reproduce the bug, and tag the issue ticket 'bug'.
* Do you have a suggestion for an enhancement? I'd love to hear it, and if you have a sketch or diagram, please upload it. Make sure to tag the issue ticket 'enhancement'.
* Do you have a question about the project? Ask away! Please tag the issue ticket 'question'.

### 3. Contribute a patch:

* On GitHub, [fork this repository](https://www.github.com/unruthless/tailwind) (we'll refer to this repository, the one at `https://www.github.com/unruthless/tailwind`, as `upstream`). Your fork (which we'll refer to as `origin`) will live on GitHub at `https://www.github.com/[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME]/tailwind`.
* Clone `origin` onto your computer to create your `working copy` of this repository.
* In your working copy, create a new branch based on master for your patch. Call this patch branch something like `patch--my-shiny-new-feature` or `patch--browser-crash`. The exact name doesn't matter; just try to make it descriptive.
* Check out your patch branch, and make your changes. Please stick to Tailwind's existing coding style, and make sure that any incremental commits have descriptive messages.
* When you're all done, push your patch branch back up to `origin` on GitHub, find the issue ticket in `upstream` that your patch addresses, and submit a pull request against that ticket. I'll review it and either merge it in or suggest changes.
* Give yourself a high five for contributing to an open source project!

## Help! I don't know what any of that stuff in Step 3 means!

A long time ago, someone sat me down for a few hours and showed me how to use this crazy git thing. (It was at a Whole Foods in Southern California, of all places. The coffeeshop next door was closed, and Whole Foods had free wifi.)

That afternoon's impromptu, hands-on lesson in version control was and remains one of the kindest and most helpful things anyone has ever done for me professionally.

I'd like to pay it forward.

<b>So: If you don't understand Step 3 at all, or sorta-kinda understand it but need a hand getting through it, email me at ruthie@cyclingcoder.com or ping me on twitter at @unruthless, and we'll schedule a coffee or Skype session and go through the whole thing together.</b>
